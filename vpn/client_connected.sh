# If above add route command fails, usually due to the route already exists, this scripts will return non-zero exit value. The client will not be able to connect.
# This is an expected behavior since only one client with the same common name is allowed to connect at the same time. Script client_disconnected.sh will remove the route when client is disconnected.
