The files in this directory are the data files required for smb-psexec.nse.

The .lua files are configurations. Each of these defines a profile for a
psexec execution.

nmap_service.exe is a program that facilitates the operation of smb-psexec.nse.
It is uploaded to the remote host and runs the programs it's directed to run,
redirecting their output to a file. This file is then downloaded by the
script and displayed to the user.

Because nmap_service.exe is tagged as spyware by some antivirus software, it is
no longer distributed together with nmap. You can download it from
https://nmap.org/psexec/nmap_service.exe or compile it from the provided
sources. The smb-psexec.nse script will remind you if you run it and
nmap_service.exe is not available.
