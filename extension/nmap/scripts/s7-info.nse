Enumerates Siemens S7 PLC Devices and collects their device information. This
script is based off PLCScan that was developed by Positive Research and
Scadastrangelove (https://code.google.com/p/plcscan/). This script is meant to
provide the same functionality as PLCScan inside of Nmap. Some of the
information that is collected by PLCScan was not ported over; this
information can be parsed out of the packets that are received.

Thanks to Positive Research, and Dmitry Efanov for creating PLCScan
