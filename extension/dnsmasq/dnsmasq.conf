# Format is one option per line, legal options are the same
# as the long options legal on the command line. See
# "/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --help" or "man 8 dnsmasq" for details.

# Listen on this specific port instead of the standard DNS port
# (53). Setting this to zero completely disables DNS function,
# leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.

# The following two options make you a better netizen, since they
# tell dnsmasq to filter out queries which the public DNS cannot
# answer, and which load the servers (especially the root servers)
# unnecessarily. If you have a dial-on-demand link they also stop
# these requests from bringing up the link unnecessarily.

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
# domain-needed
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.

# If you want dnsmasq to change uid and gid to something other
# than the default, edit the following lines.
user=pi
group=pi

# Set this (and domain: see below) if you want to have a domain
# automatically added to simple names in a hosts-file.

# Set the cachesize here.

# If you want to disable negative caching, uncomment this.
