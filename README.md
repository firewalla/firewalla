### Raspberry Pi (Strongly Not Recommended, this image is out-of-date)
```
If you have Raspberry Pi 3 and want a preview.  The preview image is a over two years old.  
Download https://github.com/firewalla/firewalla/releases/download/1.6/firewalla1.6a.img.gz
Prepare a blank microsd card > 8GB size
Follow the same step as installing a raspberry pi image
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/
```
We are focusing on delivering the official hardware, hence Raspberry Pi support is a bit lacking, we are hoping to pick it up soon.  We will be very likely selling a development version of Firewalla very soon.  It will be at cost with a small mark up to take care the labor involved. 

## Build By Yourself

If anything bad happens, unplug it. :)  The raspberry pi version uses bluetooth to link the app with the board. Final hardware will require a scan of a barcode.
