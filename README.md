## Firewalla  (Beta)
Support (email help@firewalla.com or jerry@firewalla.com)
https://forum.firewalla.com/

*WARNING* Until the middle of November, we will be focusing pushing out the Firewalla Device.  During this period, we absolutely have no time to make Raspberry pi or Docker images perfectly working.  This means, unless you are using 'master' or 'release_5_0' branch, the image may or may not work with the iOS / Android App.  Please send us help@firewalla.com a email to request beta images.  Yes, we are excited! (and nervous and many other crazy feelings)

We do have developers units avaliable for early trials and write code on.  The quantity is limited, and they will carry a developers license and in price range of 45 dollars.  The case will be 3D printed until we get the real plastic.  If interested, please email jerry@firewalla.com  These units will ship in September.
## Install From Image
```
If you have Raspberry Pi 3 and want a preview.  The preview image is a over 6 months old.  
Download https://github.com/firewalla/firewalla/releases/download/1.6/firewalla1.6a.img.gz
Prepare a blank microsd card > 8GB size
Follow the same step as installing a raspberry pi image
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/


```
We are focusing on delivering the official hardware, hence Raspberry Pi support is a bit lacking, we are hoping to pick it up soon.  We will be very likely selling a development version of Firewalla very soon.  It will be at cost with a small mark up to take care the labor involved. 

### To Build On Raspberry Pi
- Download Jessie Lite
```
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
follow direction to flash this to a card
```
- Boot Pi and update
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y  dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install git

```
- Configure Pi
```
- sudo raspi-config
- Change Password
- Host Name
- Advance Options -> Memory Split (Change to 16)
- Expand File System
- Reboot
```

- Install On Device
```
git clone https://github.com/firewalla/firewalla --branch release_pi_1_0 --single-branch
cd firewalla
./buildraw
sudo apt-get clean


** for development please create your own branch. (release_pi_1_0 is for official releases)

```

### Build On Docker (Beta, for development purpose only)
```
cd docker
docker build -f Dockerfile2 -t firewalla .
docker run --privileged -p 8833:8833 -p 8834:8834 -ti firewalla
# to get an interactive shell
docker run --privileged -p 8833:8833 -p 8834:8834 -ti firewalla su - pi
```

### Get iPhone Software

Encipher Connect is a secure messenger used to talk to Raspberry Pi.

```
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firewalla/id1180904053
```

* connect ethernet port to router.
* install firewalla from app store.
* launch firewalla 
* tap on 'Firewalla' and connect

If anything bad happens, unplug it. :)  The raspberry pi version uses bluetooth to link the app with the board. Final hardware will require a scan of a barcode.

### Contributions

* origin/master:  latest / greatest
* release_pi_1:   current released code for pi, will be pulled automatically by all deployed boards.
* dev_<>: development branchs.
* Please do a pull request for features
