# Example ZeekControl node configuration.
#
# This example has a standalone node ready to go except for possibly changing
# the sniffing interface.

# This is a complete standalone configuration.  Most likely you will
# only need to change the interface.

#type=standalone
#host=localhost

## Below is an example clustered configuration. If you use this,
## remove the [zeek] node above.
