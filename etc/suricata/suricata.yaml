## Step 3: Configure common capture settings
##
## See "Advanced Capture Options" below for more options, including Netmap
## and PF_RING.
##

# Linux high speed capture support
af-packet:
  - interface: default
    # Number of receive threads. "auto" uses the number of cores
    #threads: auto
    # Default clusterid. AF_PACKET will load balance packets based on flow.
    cluster-id: 99
    # Default AF_PACKET cluster type. AF_PACKET can load balance per flow or per hash.
    # This is only supported for Linux kernel > 3.1
    # possible value are:
    #  * cluster_flow: all packets of a given flow are sent to the same socket
    #  * cluster_cpu: all packets treated in kernel by a CPU are sent to the same socket
    #  * cluster_qm: all packets linked by network card to a RSS queue are sent to the same
    #  socket. Requires at least Linux 3.14.
    #  * cluster_ebpf: eBPF file load balancing. See doc/userguide/capture-hardware/ebpf-xdp.rst for
    #  more info.
    # Recommended modes are cluster_flow on most boxes and cluster_cpu or cluster_qm on system
    # with capture card using RSS (requires cpu affinity tuning and system IRQ tuning)
    cluster-type: cluster_flow
    # In some fragmentation cases, the hash can not be computed. If "defrag" is set
    # to yes, the kernel will do the needed defragmentation before sending the packets.
    defrag: yes
    # To use the ring feature of AF_PACKET, set 'use-mmap' to yes
    use-mmap: yes
    # Lock memory map to avoid it being swapped. Be careful that over
    # subscribing could lock your system
    #mmap-locked: yes
    # Use tpacket_v3 capture mode, only active if use-mmap is true
    # Don't use it in IPS or TAP mode as it causes severe latency
    tpacket-v3: yes
    # Ring size will be computed with respect to "max-pending-packets" and number
    # of threads. You can set manually the ring size in number of packets by setting
    # the following value. If you are using flow "cluster-type" and have really network
    # intensive single-flow you may want to set the "ring-size" independently of the number
    # of threads:
    #ring-size: 2048
    # Block size is used by tpacket_v3 only. It should set to a value high enough to contain
    # a decent number of packets. Size is in bytes so please consider your MTU. It should be
    # a power of 2 and it must be multiple of page size (usually 4096).
    block-size: 65536
    # tpacket_v3 block timeout: an open block is passed to userspace if it is not
    # filled after block-timeout milliseconds.
    #block-timeout: 10
    # On busy systems, set it to yes to help recover from a packet drop
    # phase. This will result in some packets (at max a ring flush) not being inspected.
    #use-emergency-flush: yes
    # recv buffer size, increased value could improve performance
    buffer-size: 65536
    # Set to yes to disable promiscuous mode
    # disable-promisc: no
    # Choose checksum verification mode for the interface. At the moment
    # of the capture, some packets may have an invalid checksum due to
    # the checksum computation being offloaded to the network card.
    # Possible values are:
    #  - kernel: use indication sent by kernel for each packet (default)
    #  - yes: checksum validation is forced
    #  - no: checksum validation is disabled
    #  - auto: Suricata uses a statistical approach to detect when
    #  checksum off-loading is used.
    # Warning: 'capture.checksum-validation' must be set to yes to have any validation
    #checksum-checks: kernel
    # BPF filter to apply to this interface. The pcap filter syntax applies here.
    bpf-filter: "not port 5353"
    # You can use the following variables to activate AF_PACKET tap or IPS mode.
    # If copy-mode is set to ips or tap, the traffic coming to the current
    # interface will be copied to the copy-iface interface. If 'tap' is set, the
    # copy is complete. If 'ips' is set, the packet matching a 'drop' action
    # will not be copied.
    #copy-mode: ips
    #copy-iface: eth1
    #  For eBPF and XDP setup including bypass, filter and load balancing, please
    #  see doc/userguide/capture-hardware/ebpf-xdp.rst for more info.

# Cross platform libpcap capture support
pcap:
  - interface: default
    # On Linux, pcap will try to use mmap'ed capture and will use "buffer-size"
    # as total memory used by the ring. So set this to something bigger
    # than 1% of your bandwidth.
    #buffer-size: 16777216
    bpf-filter: "not port 5353"
    # set snaplen, if not set it defaults to MTU if MTU can be known
    # via ioctl call and to full capture if not.
    snaplen: 65536

# See "Advanced Capture Options" below for more options, including Netmap
# and PF_RING.

## Step 4: App Layer Protocol configuration
##

# Configure the app-layer parsers. The protocol's section details each
# protocol.
#
# The option "enabled" takes 3 values - "yes", "no", "detection-only".
# "yes" enables both detection and the parser, "no" disables both, and
# "detection-only" enables protocol detection only (parser disabled).

      # - bypass:  stop processing this flow as much as possible. No further
      #            TLS parsing and inspection. Offload flow bypass to kernel
      #            or hardware if possible.
      # - full:    keep tracking and inspection as normal. Unmodified content
      #            keyword signatures are inspected as well.

## Advanced Traffic Tracking and Reconstruction Settings

# Defrag settings:

defrag:
  memcap: 32mb
  hash-size: 65536
  trackers: 65535 # number of defragmented flows to follow
  max-frags: 65535 # number of fragments to keep (higher than trackers)
  prealloc: yes
  timeout: 60

# Flow settings:
# By default, the reserved memory (memcap) for flows is 32MB. This is the limit
# for flow allocation inside the engine. You can change this value to allow
# more memory usage for flows.
# The hash-size determines the size of the hash used to identify flows inside
# the engine, and by default the value is 65536.
# At startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.
# emergency-recovery is the percentage of flows that the engine needs to
# prune before clearing the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing new flows to be created, but
# pruning them with the emergency timeouts (they are defined below).
# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doesn't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more aggressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the oldest flows using
# last time seen flows.
# The memcap can be specified in kb, mb, gb.  Just a number indicates it's
# in bytes.

# This option controls the use of VLAN ids in the flow (and defrag)
# hashing. Normally this should be enabled, but in some (broken)
# setups where both sides of a flow are not tagged with the same VLAN
# tag, we can ignore the VLAN id's in the flow hashing.
vlan:
  use-for-tracking: true

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determines the seconds to wait after a handshake or
# stream startup before the engine frees the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if that time elapses
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero). "bypassed"
# timeout controls locally bypassed flows. For these flows we don't do any other
# tracking. If no packets have been seen after this timeout, the flow is discarded.
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables
# use the prefix "emergency-" and work similar as the normal ones.
# Some timeouts doesn't apply to all the protocols, like "closed", for udp and
# icmp.
